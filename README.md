### Ignore Whitespace
Adding `?w=1` to any diff URL will remove any changes only in whitespace, enabling you to see only the code that has changed.

### Adjust Tab Space
Adding `?ts=4` to a diff or file URL will display tab characters as 4 spaces wide instead of the default 8. The number after `ts` can be adjusted to suit your preference. This does not work on Gists, or raw file views, but a [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-size-on-github/ofjbgncegkdemndciafljngjbdpfmbkn) or [Opera extension](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/github-tab-size/) can automate this.

Here is a Go source file before adding `?ts=4`:

...and this is after adding `?ts=4`:

### Commit History by Author
To view all commits on a repo by author add `?author={user}` to the URL.

```
https://github.com/rails/rails/commits/master?author=dhh
```

### Cloning a Repository
When cloning a repository the `.git` can be left off the end.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tiimgreen/github-cheat-sheet
```

### Branch
#### Compare all Branches to Another Branch

If you go to the repo's [Branches](https://github.com/tiimgreen/github-cheat-sheet/branches) page, next to the Commits button:

```
https://github.com/{user}/{repo}/branches
```

... you would see a list of all branches which are not merged into the main branch.

From here you can access the compare page or delete a branch with a click of a button.
